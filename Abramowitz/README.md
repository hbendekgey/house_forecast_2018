Professor Alan Abramowitz proposes a simple structuralist model for house and senate prediction. To predict the net change in Republican-held seats in a midterm election year, we need three pieces of information: which party currently holds the Presidency, the generic ballot margin in early September, and the number of seats Republicans currently hold. 

A recreation of his methodology yeilds a regression with high standard errors, and therefore a good amount of uncertainty about what will happen in 2018. These models give Democrats a 70% chance of taking the house and a 7% chance of taking the Senate.
