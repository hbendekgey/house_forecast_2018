# House 2018 Forecast

Bafumi, Erikson, and Wlezien propose a model for forecasting US house midterm elections based on data available by early July. They content that forecasts are primarily useful when submitted long enough in advance that stakeholders can respond appropriately. 

In this report I will recreate their methodology to predict the results of the 2018 midterm elections in the house of representatives. My goal is not only to produce forecasts but to bring attention to weak points in the methodology and where different choices can be made which would yield different results than the ones I obtained.
