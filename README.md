# House 2018 Forecast

Midterm election modelling is largely broken up into a few camps: Structuralists, Synthesizers, and Experts. Synthesizers are the most common, or at least the most pervasive: they combine strucutral knowledge with polls to provide constantly shifting predictions that swing with the daily polls. This is what Fivethirtyeight, Election Lab and other popular websites are doing. These are the most exciting predictions, but because they produce dozens (sometimes one per day) of predictions for a single race, it can be difficult to assess the accuracy of the intermediate predictions. They are often judged by their final predictions and some level of stability in their predictions over time. But stability isn't always good; elections change, and you want the predictions to change to reflect them. Watching only these models can lead to an obsession with daily twists and turns that mask an important underlying truth: elections are predictable.

Elections are not just predictable a day in advance. In fact, a forecast produced on the day before the election is worth little compared to one produced months in advance. An early enough forecast can help election stakeholders make decisions about campaign strategies and the allocation of resources. Academic literature has shown that elections can be predicted months in advance. Structuralists try to predict using situational factors that are rooted in theory. For example, if the economy is doing poorly, one would expect voters to swing away from the party currently in control of the government. Structuralists use data like economic performance in their forecasts.

Finally, experts attempt to simply use expert opinions months in advance to predict election results. These have historically been extremely accurate as well, but 2016 was not a good year for this camp. Was that a blip, or indicative of an underlying fault that will follow us into 2018?

These forecasts are providing very different predictions for the 2018 midterm elections. In order to make sense of what pundits are telling you, you must understand why people disagree. In addition, I am providing avenues for you to edit parameters in the various models so that you can create a model that reflects your beliefs about how elections work, and how this one will go.
